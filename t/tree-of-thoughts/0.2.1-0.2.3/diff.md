 # Here's the documentation for the inputs of the optimized Tree of Thoughts model:
 
-x (str): The initial problem statement or prompt for which the Tree of Thoughts algorithm will generate a solution.
-
-k (int, default=5): The number of thoughts to generate at each state. A higher value of k will result in more thoughts being generated, potentially leading to a more diverse set of solutions. However, increasing k may also increase the computational complexity and time required to find a solution.
-
-T (int, default=3): The maximum depth of the search tree. A higher value of T allows the algorithm to explore deeper states, potentially leading to better solutions. However, increasing T may also increase the computational complexity and time required to find a solution.
+## x (str): 
+The initial problem statement or prompt for which the Tree of Thoughts algorithm will generate a solution.
 
-b (int, default=5): The branching factor of the search tree, which determines the maximum number of child nodes for each parent node. A higher value of b allows the algorithm to explore more states, potentially leading to better solutions. However, increasing b may also increase the computational complexity and time required to find a solution.
+## k (int, default=5): 
+The number of thoughts to generate at each state. 
+A higher value of k will result in more thoughts being generated, potentially leading to a more diverse set of solutions. However, increasing k may also increase the computational complexity and time required to find a solution.
 
-vth (float, default=0.5): The value threshold for pruning states. States with a value below this threshold will be discarded, reducing the search space. A higher value of vth will result in a more aggressive pruning strategy, potentially speeding up the search process. However, setting vth too high may cause the algorithm to discard promising states, leading to suboptimal solutions.
+## T (int, default=3): 
+The maximum depth of the search tree. 
+A higher value of T allows the algorithm to explore deeper states, potentially leading to better solutions. However, increasing T may also increase the computational complexity and time required to find a solution.
 
-timeout (int, default=10): The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for the search process. If the search process exceeds this time limit, the algorithm will return the best solution found so far.
+## b (int, default=5): 
+The branching factor of the search tree, which determines the maximum number of child nodes for each parent node.
+A higher value of b allows the algorithm to explore more states, potentially leading to better solutions. However, increasing b may also increase the computational complexity and time required to find a solution.
 
-confidence_threshold (float, default=0.8): The confidence threshold for determining when a solution is satisfactory. If the algorithm finds a solution with a confidence value above this threshold, it will return the solution immediately.
+## vth (float, default=0.5): 
+The value threshold for pruning states. 
+States with a value below this threshold will be discarded, reducing the search space. A higher value of vth will result in a more aggressive pruning strategy, potentially speeding up the search process. However, setting vth too high may cause the algorithm to discard promising states, leading to suboptimal solutions.
 
-max_iterations (int, default=40): The maximum number of iterations allowed for the search process. If the search process exceeds this number of iterations, the algorithm will return the best solution found so far.
+## timeout (int, default=10): 
+The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for the search process. If the search process exceeds this time limit, the algorithm will return the best solution found so far.
 
-convergence_threshold (float, default=0.01): The convergence threshold for determining when the search process has converged. If the difference in confidence values between consecutive iterations is below this threshold for a specified number of iterations (convergence_count), the algorithm will return the best solution found so far.
+## confidence_threshold (float, default=0.8): 
+The confidence threshold for determining when a solution is satisfactory. If the algorithm finds a solution with a confidence value above this threshold, it will return the solution immediately.
